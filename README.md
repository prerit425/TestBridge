---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The **Admin** creates an exam and uploads questions.  
2. The **Student** logs in, selects the exam, and answers the questions.  
3. The **System** automatically grades the answers and stores the result.  
4. The **Result Dashboard** displays scores and performance analysis in real time.

## 💾 Database Design

### Main Tables:

| Table Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `students` | Stores student details (ID, name, email, password) |
| `admins` | Stores admin credentials |
| `exams` | Contains exam title, subject, duration, total marks |
| `questions` | Holds question text, options, and correct answers |
| `results` | Stores student results, scores, and timestamps |

### Relationships:
- One **exam** → many **questions**  
- One **student** → many **results**  
- One **admin** → many **exams**

### Security:
- Passwords encrypted (e.g., bcrypt).  
- Access controlled through user roles and tokens.
